<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Dhruv Gupta, a passionate and dedicated UI/UX designer and WEB DEVELOPER with a keen eye for detail and a love for creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. With a background in [COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING(DATA SCIENCE]. <br /> I have honed my skills in both user interface and user experience design, and also in development ensuring that every project I undertake is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and accessible. <br />
  Over the past 1 years, I have worked on a diverse range of projects, from mobile apps and websites to complex enterprise software, always striving to understand the needs and behaviors of users. My expertise lies in wireframing, prototyping, user research, and visual design, and I am proficient in using tools such as Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, and InVision. <br />
  I believe that good design is about solving problems and improving lives, and I am constantly exploring new trends and techniques to stay at the forefront of the industry. Collaboration and communication are at the heart of my design process, and I enjoy working closely with clients and team members to bring ideas to life. <br />
  When I'm not designing, you can find me [Your Hobbies or Interests], which helps me stay creative and inspired. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and opportunities, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just have a chat about design!
